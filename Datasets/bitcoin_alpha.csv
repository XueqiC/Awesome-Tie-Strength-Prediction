Keep in mind that PayPal related ratings don\'t mean anything until about 30 days since that\'s how long it often takes the owner of a stolen account to find out about it. If you trade I encourage you to record the amount traded and the PayPal email used. If later on he sends from a different PP account it\'s probably a stolen one.

3752,49,1,"The transaction was split into smaller chunks to insure that there was no counterparty risk. In addition, we used GPG contract."
3752,494,1,We traded using GPG.
3752,954,1,"I bought a handful of Cuban cigars. He acted rapidly, so that I could have them on time. We signed the transaction using our GPG keys."

3752,3454,10,We are colleagues and friends IRL. We have completed multiple transactions IRL.
3752,3647,1,We were talking on #bitcoin-otc and he offered to send me some LTC just for testing. I send him a very small amount of BTC and because the amount was too insignificant we did not use any kind of identification.
3752,3654,2,"He is taking security seriously by requiring the bank transfer message to contain a certain URL which explains the current transaction, that way scams are prevented. We used GPG for all the trades."
3752,3750,-2,I have never traded in my life with him. He negatively rated me all by himself. He has almost 0 reputation and when I tried to contact him to give me some explanation for this incident he did not reply to my email and also his email which is registered with his GPG is a @tormail.org address...
